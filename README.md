Stock-Flow Consistent Model 

Post-Keynesian Stock-Flow Consistent Model designed with demand-determined output (with supply-side constraint), money as endogenous, fundamental uncertainty/bounded rationality and income distribution to affect economic activity. This model is run with 3 sectors: firms, households and banks. The firms make investments by retained profits, loans and equity, the households accumulate savings and the banks provide firm loans by creating deposits.
